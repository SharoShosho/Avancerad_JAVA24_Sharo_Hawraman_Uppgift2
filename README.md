### Student database
--- 
##### This is a project and a assignment from school where i was training on making a data base with an array list. When using the program an file will appear called "Students.txt" where all the info and saved students youv written down will be loaded and saved.
##### To use the program you simply just foolow the instructions that is given in the console, its easy and quick to use. 


##### I decided to use Array list in this project because i thougt it was the easiest to inplement and combine with "finding and identify" data and info when searching for a student (in this projekt).

##### The sources iv uset to help me understand, get isnpiration and actually code this project has been Geekforgeeks, stackoverflow och chatGPT. Recomend heavely for unexperienced programers. 

##### Hope you guys like it and can learn from this projekt!!
